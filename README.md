## Trivia

> The [Atlantic blue marlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_blue_marlin) (Makaira nigricans) is a species of marlin endemic to the Atlantic Ocean. It is closely related to, and usually considered conspecific with, the Indo-Pacific blue marlin, then simply called blue marlin. Some authorities still consider both species distinct.
